To solve this problem, a greedy strategy that minimizes the average waiting time does exist. The algorithm is as follows:

1. Sort the jobs in non-decreasing order of their arrival times.
2. Initialize two queues, one for each processor (P1 and P2).
3. Iterate through the sorted jobs and assign each job to the processor with the shorter queue, ensuring that the total execution time on each processor does not exceed the total execution time on the other processor.
4. Calculate the waiting time for each job as the time it was assigned to the processor minus its arrival time.
5. Compute the average waiting time as the sum of waiting times divided by the total number of jobs.

Here's an example of how the greedy strategy works:

Let's say we have three jobs with their arrival times and execution times:

Job 1: Arrival time (A1) = 0, Execution time (E1) = 3
Job 2: Arrival time (A2) = 2, Execution time (E2) = 2
Job 3: Arrival time (A3) = 4, Execution time (E3) = 4

1. Sort the jobs by arrival time:
   - Job 1 (A1 = 0)
   - Job 2 (A2 = 2)
   - Job 3 (A3 = 4)

2. Initialize two empty queues for P1 and P2.

3. Start assigning jobs to processors:
   - Job 1 is assigned to P1.
   - Job 2 is assigned to P2.

   After this step, the current state is:
   P1: Job 1 (E1 = 3)
   P2: Job 2 (E2 = 2)

   Since Job 3 cannot be assigned to P1 (its arrival time is later than the total execution time of P1), we assign it to P2.

   Now, the current state is:
   P1: Job 1 (E1 = 3)
   P2: Job 2 (E2 = 2), Job 3 (E3 = 4)

4. Calculate waiting times:
   - Waiting time for Job 1 = 0 (time it was assigned) - 0 (arrival time) = 0
   - Waiting time for Job 2 = 0 (time it was assigned) - 2 (arrival time) = -2 (Job 2 didn't have to wait)
   - Waiting time for Job 3 = 2 (time it was assigned) - 4 (arrival time) = -2 (Job 3 didn't have to wait)

5. Calculate the average waiting time:
   (0 - 2 - 2) / 3 = -4 / 3 â‰ˆ -1.33

The average waiting time is approximately -1.33. The negative waiting times indicate that the jobs did not have to wait and were scheduled efficiently. This is the output of the greedy strategy.

If you have a different set of jobs, you can follow the same approach to schedule them and calculate the average waiting time.
